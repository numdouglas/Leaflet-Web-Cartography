The app is built with functionality to make data analysis and navigation as simple as possible. The sliderControl tool will highlight all the areas affected
 by fires throughout the years to the presently selected year. The layer tool contains the data for the areas affected throughout the seasons. 
Alongside this is data on the areas hit by fires throughout the decades and interactive data on the size of the fire. The fire size markers can be selcted to
 display important information on the season,type,date and the area affected by that fire vent in Hectares. To make the event more vivid, an image is 
included with every firepoint. Take a look at the legend to get a perspective of just how hard the various districts have been hit.
